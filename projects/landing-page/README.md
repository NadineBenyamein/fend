## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Workflow

In this project, a static landing page has been converted into an interactive one with the use of JavaScript.
A fourth section was added to the page. A navigation menu has been built as an unordered list with the names of the sections on the page, and each linking and scrolling to its section upon clicking. The page behavior has also been updated to show which section is being viewed upon scrolling.
